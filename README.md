# Mnemonic Creator
Large sequences of numbers can be difficult to remember. This program is to help you memorize those numbers, such as your credit card, social security number or phone numbers.

### How it works
For numbers 0-9 you may specify the letters which will translate to those numbers. The default assigning is as follows:

0: s,z\
1: t,d\
2: n\
3: m\
4: r\
5: l\
6: j,g\
7: c,k\
8: f,v\
9: p,b

The word "cat" would translate to the number sequence 71. The c translates to 7 and t translates to 1. Notice the a is not in the table and thus is ignored. Now say you wanted to memorize the number 7923. One combination this Mnemonic Creator makes for that given number is "cheap anime". Now you may be able to see how larger sequences of numbers can be a lot easier to remember by just memorizing a few words instead (and also memorizing your table).

### Config
Currently all editing is done in macros.h so you can modify what word bank the program uses and what letter mappings you would like to use.
